- Attention + Long Short Term Network
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Gated Recurrent Units
- Self Attention
- Stacked Long Short Term Network
- Viterbi
- ViterbiNet

### ISI_Channel

A generative dataset that provides a simulation process of models.

### matrix_reshape

A script used as a helper function for the ISI channel.

### model_summary
A Jupyter notebook containing the neural network implementations and their training summary tables.
